Terra~~Firma~~FabricCraft
=======
A Fabric Port of the TerraFirmaCraft mod, from the 1.7.10 version
---

##Questions

Q: Why forked from the 1.7.10 version? Why not a newer one?
A: I know (and trust) the GPL more than the EUPL (In fact I had never heard of it before).

Q: Why is there not much code here?
A: I plan to split the fabric version into multiple standalone mods which can also be configured to work together in a way like TFC. A list of the repos is below:
- \<Nothing yet\>

## About

The goal of TFC is to make things more [believable](http://terrafirmacraft.com/index.html/_/articles/believable-r64), and to give the player a sense of accomplishment. Mastering skills, and searching far and wide to gather materials before you can build amazing castles, homes, fortresses, towns, cities, etc. The overhauled terrain generation also creates a beautiful, varied background as a canvas to start your builds.

## License

This mod is licensed under GNU GPL v3

## Downloads

Downloads can be found on the in the releases column. If enough people ask, I will consider putting it on CurseForge/Modrinth 

## Issues

The GitHub issue tracker is *only* for reporting issues that appear in the latest development stage of TFC (i.e. Issues that exist when running the repository using the latest commit on the master branch, and do not exist in released versions of TFC). Any issues that can be reproduced using the current released version of the mod will simply be closed.

## Credits

A list of developers and other primary contributors can be found on the [official website](http://terrafirmacraft.com/credits.html). Additionally, major contrubutors to the port will be added to the fabric.mod.json with (Port) next to their name.
